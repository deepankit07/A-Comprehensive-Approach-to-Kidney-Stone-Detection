# A-Comprehensive-Approach-to-Kidney-Stone-Detection
This repository presents a comprehensive kidney stone detection system that leverages machine learning models for accurate medical diagnosis. It includes:

Data preprocessing & analysis of patient medical reports

Model building & evaluation with multiple ML algorithms

Kidney Stone Prediction Web App for real-time diagnosis

End-to-end workflow: from raw data → trained models → interactive application

The project is designed to demonstrate how AI-driven healthcare solutions can assist in early detection and clinical decision-making.
